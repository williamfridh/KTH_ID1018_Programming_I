**The course covers fundamental programming concepts including syntax, variables, control structures, functions, and data structures. It also explores algorithmic problem-solving, exception management, and Object-Oriented Programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and exceptions. Upon completion, students should be able to analyze, modify, and create simple programs, understand data representation, design and implement programs using basic I/O and conditionals, develop algorithms, manage exceptions, and apply OOP principles in program design.**

This repository contains solutions and reports for all assignments for the course [ID1018](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/ID1018). I've posted these solutions as I know that they can came as handy when students gets stuck and/or needs inspiration to solve similar problems.

Please avoid copying this work directly as it ruins the process of learning. Instead look at these solutions when you are 100% stuck. Note that code written by me is marked by comments.
